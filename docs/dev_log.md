task: "Track volume and file metadata"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "8d994da"
tags: [feature, db]
---

**Summary.** Introduced persistent metadata tables so the catalog now remembers per-volume usage snapshots and per-file attributes alongside the raw event stream.

**Highlights.**
- Added Alembic migration + schema updates for `volumes` and `files` tables, and wired disk usage sampling with lightweight refresh heuristics (`migrations/versions/0002_volume_and_file_metadata.py`, `src/diskwatcher/db/events.py:130`).
- File upserts now capture size/mtime while delete markers keep the row for history; volume rows cache usage totals and event counters for richer dashboards (`src/diskwatcher/db/events.py:200`).
- CLI `config show` surfaces storage paths so operators know where the DB/logs/config live, and README documents the storage layout (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:182`, `README.md:75`).
- `diskwatcher status` now returns volume usage metadata in both text and JSON modes so operators immediately see capacity snapshots (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:205`).
- SQLite connections gained WAL + busy-timeouts with retry logic so heavy scans no longer explode on transient locks (`src/diskwatcher/db/connection.py:24`, `src/diskwatcher/db/events.py:20`).
- Initial archival scans emit structured progress logs and retain stats so operators can track long sweeps (`src/diskwatcher/core/watcher.py:54`).
- Added regression tests that cover scan stats and manager status reporting (`tests/test_diskwatcher.py:178`).
- Expanded pytest coverage to assert metadata tables stay in sync and confirmed migrations stamp the new baseline (`tests/test_db.py:86`).

**Challenges.**
- Avoiding noisy disk-usage sampling required balancing time and event-count thresholds so watchers stay light.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider exposing a `status --json` enrichment that joins into the new tables for operators who want usage + file size telemetry directly from the CLI.

task: "Add CLI configuration management"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "2f7d437"
tags: [feature, cli, config]
---

**Summary.** Introduced a config subsystem with a `diskwatcher config` namespace so operators can inspect defaults, tweak log levels, and control the run bootstrap without cracking open JSON by hand.

**Highlights.**
- Added a typed registry that persists to `~/.diskwatcher/config.json`, supports env overrides, and normalises log levels while preserving defaults (`src/diskwatcher/utils/config.py`).
- Hooked the Typer callback and run loop into the config values so `log.level` and `run.auto_scan` govern logging setup and the archival sweep (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:36`, `src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:62`).
- Documented the new `config show/set/unset/path` commands and covered them with subprocess smoke tests to guarantee JSON output stays parseable (`tests/test_cli.py:60`, `README.md:75`).
- Surfaced storage paths (config/db/log) via `config show` so operators know exactly where artifacts land (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:197`).

**Challenges.**
- CLI logging spammed stdout during `config show --json`, so the tests now strip leading log lines before decoding.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider exposing directory presets (`run.directories`) next so labs can pre-wire mount targets.

branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "f856e24"
tags: [ci, tests]
---

**Summary.** Hooked the new subprocess smoke tests (and the wider pytest suite) into a GitHub Actions workflow so every push and PR runs the CLI coverage we just added.

**Highlights.**
- Added a single-job CI workflow that installs the package in editable mode and executes `pytest -q`, ensuring the CLI smoke checks run by default (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:1`).
- Kept the matrix lean (Python 3.12) to match the lab environment while leaving room to extend versions later.
- Verified pip upgrade + editable install succeeds before pytest executes, guarding against missing dependencies during automation.

**Challenges.**
- Balancing install speed with dependency completeness required splitting `pip install -e .` and `pytest` extras so Actions stays fast but deterministic.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider expanding the matrix once we certify watcher stability on older Python versions.

commit: "f856e24"
tags: [tests, ci]
---

**Summary.** Added subprocess-driven smoke tests so the Typer callback wiring and console entrypoint stay healthy, and locked in validation for unsupported log-level values to mirror production usage.

**Highlights.**
- Subprocess helper forces `python -m diskwatcher.core.cli --help` through a temp HOME/PYTHONPATH without touching the operator profile (`tests/test_cli.py:17`).
- Added failure-path coverage for bogus `--log-level` inputs so we fail fast with actionable messaging (`tests/test_cli.py:33`).
- Re-ran the CLI test suite to ensure the new checks complement the existing runner coverage.

**Challenges.**
- Keeping environment overrides hermetic enough for subprocesses while leaving existing monkeypatched fixtures alone took a few iterations (`tests/test_cli.py:20`).

**Suggestions.**
- Wire these smoke tests into CI's default matrix so regressions surface before packaging drops.

branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "f856e24"
tags: [bugfix, cli]
---

**Summary.** Repaired the console entrypoint so `diskwatcher --help` no longer crashes and tightened how we parse the `--log-level` option. Added friendly validation plus a legacy alias so existing scripts keep working while the new packaging target stays consistent.

**Highlights.**
- Split the Typer callback into `configure_logging` and a lightweight `main` launcher to align with the generated console script.
- Normalized log-level handling with a case-insensitive map and explicit error messaging (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:21`).
- Swapped residual `click.echo` usage for `typer.echo` to avoid missing imports in the log command.

**Challenges.**
- Confirmed the editable install still pointed at the older console stub, so I kept `main()` as a backward-compatible alias (`src/diskwatcher/core/cli.py:370`).

**Suggestions.**
- Consider adding a lightweight CLI smoke test in CI to catch entrypoint regressions before release.

---

**Summary.** Validated the new dashboard/stream commands, checked supporting docs, and prepped the repo for a clean commit of the integration test tooling.


**Highlights.**
- Exercised the CLI additions plus integration harness with `pytest -q` to confirm everything passes without the integration flag.
- Tidied ignored artifact directories so `tests/test_out/` only tracks guidance, keeping git status lean.
- Verified README and developer log changes capture the new workflows before locking them into history.

---

**Summary.** Introduced a `diskwatcher stream` command that emits NDJSON so we can tail live activity, pipe it into VisiData, and keep the workflow lightweight.

**Highlights.**
- Added `query_events_since` helper and CLI command options for poll interval/limit, plus tests to keep the loop deterministic.
- README now documents piping the stream into `vd` along with the updated integration rehearsal notes.

**Challenges.**
- Ensuring the loop exits cleanly for tests without threads led to a hidden `--max-iterations` guard.

**Suggestions.**
- If we want richer streaming summaries, consider emitting periodic aggregates alongside the raw NDJSON.

commit: "df1072a"
tags: [feature, tests, doc]
---

**Summary.** Captured the practice procedure for running integration tests on lab media and added a `diskwatcher dashboard` command so operators can browse the catalog without cracking SQLite by hand.

**Highlights.**
- New dashboard command surfaces recent files plus volume aggregates with either text or JSON output, backed by a `summarize_files` helper and CLI tests.
- README now explains how to stage `/mnt/e` runs, keep artifacts, and stash representative outputs under `tests/test_out/` for future reference.

**Challenges.**
- Keeping the dashboard readable without external deps meant hand-rolling compact text formatting while still exposing rich JSON when needed.

**Suggestions.**

commit: "df1072a"
tags: [tests, doc]

**Summary.** Taught the integration suite to stash its SQLite snapshots and JSON outputs so we can audit watcher runs, and refreshed the README with the inspection workflow.

**Highlights.**
- Integration test now writes `events.json` and `status.json` whenever artifacts are retained, giving us a quick view into watcher traffic and CLI payloads.
- Verified the flow under `--keep-artifacts`, confirming the catalog plus emitted JSON land under `logs/artifacts/<timestamp>/...`.

**Challenges.**
- Attempting to stream artifacts directly into `/mnt/e` hit permission errors on this runner; documented the workaround and kept the run in the sandbox for now.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider provisioning a writable scratch directory on external mounts (or adjusting ACLs) so integration runs can target real devices without manual prep.

commit: "N/A"
tags: [tests, infra]
---

**Summary.** Built a pytest-facing integration harness with watcher threads plus CLI verification, and added artifact retention flags so we can inspect catalogs after a run.

**Highlights.**
- New `artifact_dir` fixture respects `--keep-artifacts`/`--artifact-dir`, letting us persist SQLite/log outputs when debugging stubborn drives.
- Manager-based integration test now exercises watcher setup, event logging, and the `diskwatcher status` JSON path end-to-end.
- README documents how to flip the integration switch so future agents know which flags to use before pointing at real media.

**Challenges.**
- Synchronising watchdog observers in-test needed deliberate sleeps and shared connections to avoid flaky event capture.
- Ensuring logging stayed inside the workspace while still writing inspectable files required extra path handling in the session fixture.

**Suggestions.**
- Add a marker-specific CI job once hardware runners exist, and consider capturing event timing metrics in artifacts for regression spotting.

commit: "N/A"
tags: [feature, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Added `diskwatcher dev vacuum` and `diskwatcher dev integrity` helpers, plus docs/tests, so operators can maintain the catalog without hand-writing sqlite commands.

**Highlights.**
- Shared URL parser ensures we can target arbitrary sqlite files while defaulting to the catalog.
- Tests exercise the dev commands through Typer to confirm logging patches still keep sandbox happy.
- README now documents the maintenance subcommands alongside revision tooling.

**Challenges.**
- Handling sqlite URLs correctly required a small helper to normalize netloc/path quirks.
- Had to keep logging initialization stubbed in tests to avoid permissions on host log files.

**Suggestions.**
- Plan a CI smoke that calls `diskwatcher dev revision --help` and `dev vacuum` to catch regressions (deferred for now).
- Consider exposing a JSON status option for integrity results if we ever need machine parsing.

**Summary.** Ported the CLI from Click to Typer, added a developer tooling group with a revision command, and refreshed tests/docs to match the new interface.

**Highlights.**
- Typer app preserves the existing commands while adding auto-generated help and options.
- Developer subcommands (`diskwatcher dev â€¦`) wrap Alembic revision creation so contributors donâ€™t juggle scripts.
- Updated tests exercise the Typer runner, the new dev command, and the migration workflow end-to-end.

**Challenges.**
- Handling optional variadic directory arguments in Typer required some extra typing glue.
- Needed to juggle imports so Alembic stays optional until the tooling command runs.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider bundling more maintenance utilities (e.g., DB vacuum) under `diskwatcher dev` next.
- Keep README examples fresh as we add Typer niceties like parameter completion.

**Summary.** Extended the status command with JSON output and per-volume aggregates, then wired in Alembic helpers so the catalog can evolve without bespoke SQL patches.

**Highlights.**
- Aggregation query surfaces volume totals and flows into the CLI and JSON output for scripting.
- Added alembic.ini, baseline revision, and helper module so future schema tweaks ride standard migrations.
- New CLI migrate command wraps Alembic upgrade logic with URL overrides for tests.
- Comprehensive tests cover status formatting, JSON, aggregation, and config wiring.

**Summary.** Reworked the watcher plumbing to share a single SQLite handle with lock protection, added CLI status reporting, and hardened mount discovery so Diskwatcher behaves like a real library instead of a demo.

**Highlights.**
- Manager now provisions one threaded-safe connection that threads reuse, eliminating per-event connects and noisy logs.
- CLI heartbeat and `status --limit` output keep operators informed while the JSON console stays clean.
- Device helpers gained timeouts and cross-platform fallbacks, so tests can stub commands without exploding.
- Added regression coverage for CLI flows, manager wiring, archival scans, and device fallbacks.

**Challenges.**
- clickâ€™s logging bootstrap fought the sandbox; patched tests to bypass file handlers while still exercising the CLI contract.
- Balancing SQLite threading rules meant touching both connection setup and watcher locks without regressing existing tests.

**Summary.** Updated AGENTS.md and agents.txt so future contributors see Diskwatcher-specific guardrails for cataloging disks and extending the watcher CLI. Reframed the workflow notes around the actual core modules, database helpers, and logging stacks so new agents land on the right entry points without spelunking.

**Highlights.**
- Clarified where to look for CLI, watcher, and database code, plus how to keep UUID mapping deterministic across mounts.
- Added guidance for documenting schema changes and using structured logging helpers that feed the catalog telemetry.
- Captured expectations about creating dev logs and JSON reflections so the handoff ritual is spelled out in one place.
