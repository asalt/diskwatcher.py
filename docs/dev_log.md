branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [review, tests]
---

**Summary.** Validated the new dashboard/stream commands, checked supporting docs, and prepped the repo for a clean commit of the integration test tooling.


**Highlights.**
- Exercised the CLI additions plus integration harness with `pytest -q` to confirm everything passes without the integration flag.
- Tidied ignored artifact directories so `tests/test_out/` only tracks guidance, keeping git status lean.
- Verified README and developer log changes capture the new workflows before locking them into history.

**Challenges.**
- Large diff set from prior agents required extra context gathering to ensure nothing critical was missed.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider splitting future feature batches so documentation, CLI, and tests land in smaller, reviewable commits.

commit: "df1072a"
tags: [doc, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Documented the `tests/test_out/` scratch workflow and updated `.gitignore` so local integration captures stay out of version control.

**Highlights.**
- README now points at the scratch directory and the expectation to mention artifacts in the dev log.
- Added a directory README and ignore rules so contributors can dump samples without worrying about commits.

**Challenges.**
- None—just coordination across docs and ignore patterns.

**Suggestions.**
- Periodically prune the scratch directory to keep local checkouts tidy.

task: "Stream catalog events"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "df1072a"
tags: [feature, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Introduced a `diskwatcher stream` command that emits NDJSON so we can tail live activity, pipe it into VisiData, and keep the workflow lightweight.

**Highlights.**
- Added `query_events_since` helper and CLI command options for poll interval/limit, plus tests to keep the loop deterministic.
- README now documents piping the stream into `vd` along with the updated integration rehearsal notes.

**Challenges.**
- Ensuring the loop exits cleanly for tests without threads led to a hidden `--max-iterations` guard.

**Suggestions.**
- If we want richer streaming summaries, consider emitting periodic aggregates alongside the raw NDJSON.

branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "df1072a"
tags: [feature, tests, doc]
---

**Summary.** Captured the practice procedure for running integration tests on lab media and added a `diskwatcher dashboard` command so operators can browse the catalog without cracking SQLite by hand.

**Highlights.**
- New dashboard command surfaces recent files plus volume aggregates with either text or JSON output, backed by a `summarize_files` helper and CLI tests.
- README now explains how to stage `/mnt/e` runs, keep artifacts, and stash representative outputs under `tests/test_out/` for future reference.

**Challenges.**
- Keeping the dashboard readable without external deps meant hand-rolling compact text formatting while still exposing rich JSON when needed.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider layering a richer TUI/HTML view atop the new JSON payload if operators want deeper drilldowns later.

branch: "main"

commit: "df1072a"
tags: [tests, doc]
---

**Summary.** Taught the integration suite to stash its SQLite snapshots and JSON outputs so we can audit watcher runs, and refreshed the README with the inspection workflow.

**Highlights.**
- Integration test now writes `events.json` and `status.json` whenever artifacts are retained, giving us a quick view into watcher traffic and CLI payloads.
- Verified the flow under `--keep-artifacts`, confirming the catalog plus emitted JSON land under `logs/artifacts/<timestamp>/...`.

**Challenges.**
- Attempting to stream artifacts directly into `/mnt/e` hit permission errors on this runner; documented the workaround and kept the run in the sandbox for now.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider provisioning a writable scratch directory on external mounts (or adjusting ACLs) so integration runs can target real devices without manual prep.

task: "Add integration harness and artifact flags"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [tests, infra]
---

**Summary.** Built a pytest-facing integration harness with watcher threads plus CLI verification, and added artifact retention flags so we can inspect catalogs after a run.

**Highlights.**
- New `artifact_dir` fixture respects `--keep-artifacts`/`--artifact-dir`, letting us persist SQLite/log outputs when debugging stubborn drives.
- Manager-based integration test now exercises watcher setup, event logging, and the `diskwatcher status` JSON path end-to-end.
- README documents how to flip the integration switch so future agents know which flags to use before pointing at real media.

**Challenges.**
- Synchronising watchdog observers in-test needed deliberate sleeps and shared connections to avoid flaky event capture.
- Ensuring logging stayed inside the workspace while still writing inspectable files required extra path handling in the session fixture.

**Suggestions.**
- Add a marker-specific CI job once hardware runners exist, and consider capturing event timing metrics in artifacts for regression spotting.

task: "Add dev maintenance commands"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [feature, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Added `diskwatcher dev vacuum` and `diskwatcher dev integrity` helpers, plus docs/tests, so operators can maintain the catalog without hand-writing sqlite commands.

**Highlights.**
- Shared URL parser ensures we can target arbitrary sqlite files while defaulting to the catalog.
- Tests exercise the dev commands through Typer to confirm logging patches still keep sandbox happy.
- README now documents the maintenance subcommands alongside revision tooling.

**Challenges.**
- Handling sqlite URLs correctly required a small helper to normalize netloc/path quirks.
- Had to keep logging initialization stubbed in tests to avoid permissions on host log files.

**Suggestions.**
- Plan a CI smoke that calls `diskwatcher dev revision --help` and `dev vacuum` to catch regressions (deferred for now).
- Consider exposing a JSON status option for integrity results if we ever need machine parsing.

task: "Migrate CLI to Typer"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [feature, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Ported the CLI from Click to Typer, added a developer tooling group with a revision command, and refreshed tests/docs to match the new interface.

**Highlights.**
- Typer app preserves the existing commands while adding auto-generated help and options.
- Developer subcommands (`diskwatcher dev …`) wrap Alembic revision creation so contributors don’t juggle scripts.
- Updated tests exercise the Typer runner, the new dev command, and the migration workflow end-to-end.

**Challenges.**
- Handling optional variadic directory arguments in Typer required some extra typing glue.
- Needed to juggle imports so Alembic stays optional until the tooling command runs.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider bundling more maintenance utilities (e.g., DB vacuum) under `diskwatcher dev` next.
- Keep README examples fresh as we add Typer niceties like parameter completion.

task: "Align in-memory schema with migrations"
branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [infra, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Made the in-memory schema adapter stamp the Alembic baseline, added a helper script for generating revisions, and refreshed developer docs to highlight the new workflow.

**Highlights.**
- `create_schema` now inserts the baseline revision alongside the SQL bootstrap so tests mirror production migration state.
- Added `scripts/new_revision.py` to wrap Alembic revision creation with friendly flags.
- README development section now points to the script and clarifies autogenerate usage.

**Challenges.**
- Avoided circular imports by grabbing Alembic constants inside the fallback path.
- Ensured new helper script manipulates `sys.path` safely when run from the repo root.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider baking the migration helper into a dedicated CLI group if we keep adding tooling commands.
- Add CI smoke to ensure `scripts/new_revision.py --help` keeps working across Python versions.

---

**Summary.** Verified mount metadata on live disks, rerouted `create_schema` to call Alembic upgrades for file-backed catalogs, and documented the richer status/migrate workflows so operators know what changed.

**Highlights.**
- Confirmed `/mnt/e` and `/media/alex` resolve to stable UUID/device combos, validating the uniqueness path we rely on.
- `init_db` now delegates to Alembic when possible, keeping in-memory tests on the fallback script.
- README now explains status JSON, migration usage, and the programmatic rollup API.

**Challenges.**
- Avoided circular imports by delaying the Alembic helper import inside `create_schema`.
- Ensured Alembic migrations run without conflicting with the active sqlite3 handle during tests.

**Suggestions.**
- Automate `alembic revision` scaffolding via a helper script so new contributors don’t need to memorize commands.
- Capture the mount-info quick check in docs/agent_playbook once that file exists.

branch: "main"
agent: "gpt-5-codex"
commit: "N/A"
tags: [feature, tooling]
---

**Summary.** Extended the status command with JSON output and per-volume aggregates, then wired in Alembic helpers so the catalog can evolve without bespoke SQL patches.

**Highlights.**
- Aggregation query surfaces volume totals and flows into the CLI and JSON output for scripting.
- Added alembic.ini, baseline revision, and helper module so future schema tweaks ride standard migrations.
- New CLI migrate command wraps Alembic upgrade logic with URL overrides for tests.
- Comprehensive tests cover status formatting, JSON, aggregation, and config wiring.

**Challenges.**
- Ensuring the baseline migration played nicely with existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` logic to avoid duplicate DDL.
- Threading Alembic dependencies without breaking lightweight installs required careful pyproject adjustments.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider migrating `create_schema` to call Alembic stamp/upgrade once we trust the workflow.
- Add automation to stamp existing installs during the next release packaging push.

commit: "N/A"
tags: [feature, tests]
---

**Summary.** Reworked the watcher plumbing to share a single SQLite handle with lock protection, added CLI status reporting, and hardened mount discovery so Diskwatcher behaves like a real library instead of a demo.

**Highlights.**
- Manager now provisions one threaded-safe connection that threads reuse, eliminating per-event connects and noisy logs.
- CLI heartbeat and `status --limit` output keep operators informed while the JSON console stays clean.
- Device helpers gained timeouts and cross-platform fallbacks, so tests can stub commands without exploding.
- Added regression coverage for CLI flows, manager wiring, archival scans, and device fallbacks.

**Challenges.**
- click’s logging bootstrap fought the sandbox; patched tests to bypass file handlers while still exercising the CLI contract.
- Balancing SQLite threading rules meant touching both connection setup and watcher locks without regressing existing tests.

**Suggestions.**
- Consider surfacing per-volume stats in `status` and exposing a JSON output mode next.
- A lightweight migration tool would help when schema changes ship beyond the flat events table.

**Summary.** Updated AGENTS.md and agents.txt so future contributors see Diskwatcher-specific guardrails for cataloging disks and extending the watcher CLI. Reframed the workflow notes around the actual core modules, database helpers, and logging stacks so new agents land on the right entry points without spelunking.

**Highlights.**
- Clarified where to look for CLI, watcher, and database code, plus how to keep UUID mapping deterministic across mounts.
- Added guidance for documenting schema changes and using structured logging helpers that feed the catalog telemetry.
- Captured expectations about creating dev logs and JSON reflections so the handoff ritual is spelled out in one place.

**Challenges.**
- No existing docs folder, so noted creation requirements while keeping instructions concrete for first contributors instead of inventing extra surfaces.
- Balancing brevity with actionable direction in agents.txt without repeating entire README copy.

**Suggestions.**
- Populate README.md with a high-level roadmap and quickstart before onboarding more help.
- Consider adding a stub `docs/agent_playbook.md` soon so future edits have a destination.
