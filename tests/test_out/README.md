# Test Output Scratch Space

Use this directory to stash large or sensitive artifacts from integration runs
(e.g. copies of `/mnt/e` captures) so they stay out of version control. The
folder is ignored by `.gitignore`, so add a note in `docs/dev_log.md` if you
keep anything here that other contributors should inspect.

Feel free to prune old files after you've finished debugging; nothing in here is
picked up by automated tests.
